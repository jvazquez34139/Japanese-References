              watashi wa shiraso desu ) There are a few things I want to explain
              about this page. Starting with the main purpose. I want to help
              give some guidance to anyone interested in learning how to speak and
              read Japanese as a self-taught learner. I went through several free
              and paid sources and services to know which are appropriate during
              any level of the learners' journey. A few of these would have saved
              me lots of time had I known about them from the beginning. This is
              the main reason for this article. I want to save new self-taught
              students a lot of time in their endeavors by pointing them in a
              somewhat organized approach for tackling the different obstacles
              faced when learning Japanese from zero experience.

              I started from 0 knowledge since I didn't have the option to learn
              this language in school but I was very interested in several things
              about it. About Japan as a country in general. The anime, food, and
              culture all together make learning Japanese so interesting.
              Knowing the language could even land me a job overseas one day.

              Lot's of tips!
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three scripts to the Japanese language and you'll most likely see
              a combination of the three in everyday text or signs in Japan. The three
              are Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. A lot of references will tell you
              to start with Hiragana. I agree with this and believe it's the best
              first step to learning the language. Learning the characters (also referred
              to as kana) of the hiragana script is will allow you to read most Japanese
              texts. You don't have to prioritize Katakana as much since it shares most
              of the same sounds. The characters are also very similar to hiragana so
              learning hiragana will help you halfway through learning katakana. The
              purpose of katakana is for spelling words of foreign origin. Ex:
              <span class="translate" title="hamburger">ハンバーガー</span>( Hanbāgā ).
              Kanji are characters from Chinese origin that the Japanese language
              has adopted during its development. After learning hiragana to where
              you can begin to read things at about a 2nd or 3rd-grade level I recommend
              studying kanji. Kanji are not just characters like hiragana and katakana.
              Each kanji or group of kanji represent a whole word or phrase. They're
              used to make texts more concise although the readings of all kanji can
              be written fully in hiragana.
              <span class="translate" title="dog">犬</span>( inu ) is the kanji for
              <span class="translate" title="dog">いぬ</span>( inu ). It's fine if
              you don't learn the readings for the kanji right away. I found it more
              effective to learn the meanings first and then learn the readings after
              you learned a few dozen kanji. If you're finding it hard to stay focused,
              or if you feel you're not making enough progress, then just keep in mind
              that it is a whole language with a completely new way of saying and reading
              the thousands of words you've already learned and practiced since the
              beginning of your life. It's not gonna happen overnight. Even just learning
              a new phrase or about 5 new words a day is very good progress. The most
              important thing is to remember to always try to find some way to use what
              you learned in your everyday life so you can retain it better. What I
              do is for 20 minutes a day I practice all the kanji I know or practice
              hiragana. Just using what you know for 20 minutes a day will keep it
              cycling through your neurons and it won't fade away. The best thing you
              can do is move to japan for a few years if you could afford it.
              learn phrases that are relevant to your everyday situations or show up
              in anime or manga often. This is best with dubbed anime. The last tip
              for the study is to try as hard as you can to not rely on looking things up you
              don't remember when you're practicing. Sure it's fine when you're learning
              it for the first time, but when it comes to practicing nothing helps more
              than forcing yourself to recall it on your own. The more you try hard
              at recalling the thing you learned the more you're brain bumps it up
              to a higher priority bin in your memories storage. It thinks if you're
              trying that hard to remember it then it must be worth knowing and it'll
              keep it at an easier access area for when you do need to use it. This
              may be a very unpopular opinion but I think it's best to skip the
              practice on writing japanese. Most do say it's import to immerse yourself
              as much as possible into the language but writing will only slow down
              your progress on learning more kanji and the grammar. In most settings
              you wont need to write a physical letter and it takes more time to practice
              writing than just learning to read it. Most of the time you'll just
              be reading it or typing it.

            <h4>Duo Lingo</h4>
            <p>
              This app is probably the best known. It offers a smooth learning
              curve. A beginner can pick it up and learn a few phrases in the first
              few days of using the app. For free it teaches the writing all three
              of the Japanese writing scripts. It slowly introduces everyday phrases
              and words as you learn basic grammar structures. It offers a competitive
              online environment via a leader board and a ranking system among
              fellow students of the same study tier as yourself. It's one way it uses
              to motivate students to put in time into playing more. It has full
              functionality in the free package. The only thing you can purchase
              are gems that are used for Duos costumes/skins and for buying streak
              freezes since streaks are part of the badge/achievement system. Gems
              can also purchase a life refill but the app lets you take a free
              practice quiz that grants you back 1 life. There's no limit to how
              many times you can do the practice test but it won't offer anything new
              from what you've already learned in your previous lessons.
            </p>

            <img src="./res/duo2.jpg" alt="screenshot"/>
            <p>
              What I didn't like about the app was that it jumps around too much
              between learning hiragana to katana to full kanji and phrases. This
              might not entirely be a bad thing as I know learning one part of a
              language in full can get boring and tiring sometimes and for some,
              this bits approach is a nice smooth way for getting a taste for
              everything and getting a faster feel for how all of it works together
              in small everyday situations. Duo lingo does seem to progressively
              increase grammatical complexity as you move on to more advanced topics.

            <h4>Kanji Tree</h4>

              <img src="./res/kanjitree.jpg" alt="kanji tree logo"/>
            </a>
            <p>
              Fully functional with just the free package. It has a 3 game modes.
              The first one is recognition. Recognition focuses on teaching you the
              meanings to the kanji. The second is readings which focuses on the main
              readings for the kanji but this instead of multiple choice is more like
              a virtual flash card and based on the honor system of whether you did
              know the answer or not. The third is Writing practice.
              It let's the user pick any list ranging from
              60-?000 kanji. It also gives the user two main settings which are Learn
              and Revize. Learn will prioritize giving you the kanji you havent seen
              first and move any already learned to the end of the list. With a
              varying random factor that is also adjustable by the user. The Revize
              setting gives the user the kanji they've seen already first, but prioritizing
              the one's that need most work. Setting the random variable to 0 will
              keep them in order from least known to most known at the end of the list.
              It also gives the kanji you learned a score of 0-10 and it goes up the
              more you get them right in multiple choice format as well as brings
              scores down if you get them wrong. It has a very good tutorial, and
              works 100% offline. It also contains a dictionary.

              My only complaints about this app is that it didnt offer more practice
              options such as typing in the answer instead of only multiple choice.
              I felt that each time i would get stuck on a kanji I was practicing it
              was just too easy for me to look at the options and get it correct by
              just process of elimination. I don't feel the learning hit as hard when
              The answer is one of just 4 options. A typed response game mode would
              have been great. Also it would be nice to have the option of making
              the users multiple choice options the that are most similar to
              the correct answer in kanji.
