              There's a few things I want to explain about this page. Starting
              off with the main purpose. I want to help give some guidence to
              anyone interested in learning how to speak and read Japanese as
              a self taught learner. I went through several free and paid sources
              and services to know which are appropriate during any level of the
              learners journey. A few of these would have saved me lot's of time
              had i known about them from the beginning. This is the main reason
              for this article. I want to save new self-taught students a lot of
              time in their endeavors by pointing them in a somewhat organized
              approach for tackling the different obstacles faced when learning
              Japanese from zero experience.

              I started from 0 knowledge since I didnt have the option to learn
              this language in school but i was very interested in several things
              about it. About Japan as a country in general. The anime, food, and
              their culture all together makes learning japanese so interesting.
              Knowing the language could even land me a job over seas one day.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="attention">
              Now to explain how this page works.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              - I have to say that I am not sponsored or paid to advertise
              any of these resources. This is all entirely just my honest opinion
              of these resources. Nor am I making any claim that anyone can self
              teach themselves using any of the methods mentioned in this page.
              Nor claiming that the resources i mentioned are the best suited for
              everybodies specific learning styles. It will all depend on how
              much time is put into the learning, focus, and determination of the
              reader.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              - I will mention resources such as physical books, android apps,
              webpages, and youtube channels, and i will talk about what comes
              included in free and paid packages. Screenshots will also be provided.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              - You dont need to read through the whole article. If you Have a
              prefered platform or method of learning you can skip to the section
              using the navigation bar. In fact most of the resources will have
              just about anything you need to get started and to learn the language
              if you put enough time and effort.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              - I will give tips i read in many resources, mentioned here or not,
              that i've read since writing this article. I will also give my own
              opinion of where to start and where a student can go next to progress
              as smooth as possible when learning Japanese.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              - I will also give my own thoughts of what certain apps or resources
              could have had to make learning more efficient for the user/reader.
